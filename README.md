## Introduction 

This goal of this project is to analyze market data for electric vehicles. The data is limited to low-cost electric vehicles in the UK and Germany. 

#Sources 

The electric car information on https://ev-database.org/ was scraped and made available in comma separated list format in the following source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/cheapest-electric-cars?resource=download

## Date Cleaning Process

- Separation of list data into columns
- Removed unecessary values
- Removed currency symbols to have have number format
-  

## Collaboration

The group cleaned the initial data set and saved it to 'clean_evcar_dataset.csv'. Folders were created for each question for team members to work on their questions and reference the same data set in the root folder to avoid manual re-work during collaboration and avoid merge conflicts.
